The project analysis corresponds to applying different Machine Learning algorithms to the Weight Lifting Exercises (WLE) Dataset (please see  http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har). Six persons (Carlitos, Pedro,    Adelmo,  Charles,  Eurico and Jeremy) were asked to perform one set of ten repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions, identified as classes A, B, C, D and E. All classes except A are designated as   common mistakes in this weight lifting exercise. So, onley class A correspnds to the correct way of the exercise. A number of sensors were used to collect data about the execution of the exercise. The purpose of this project is to establish an effective predictive algorithm where the sensor measures serve as predictors and the outcome is the corresponding class from A to E.

The analysis uses regression tree and random forest prediction algorithm after some data cleaning. The  analysis confirm that the model provided by the random forest algorithm provides almost perfect prediction accuracy.
